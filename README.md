This project aims to develop an advanced deep learning system for nutrition analysis using food images. The system integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing, transfer learning techniques,
and data augmentation methods to accurately classify food items and estimate their nutritional content. The project includes components for food recognition, nutrient estimation, meal planning, 
and personalized dietary recommendations. The system is implemented using Python, deep learning frameworks, and Streamlit for the user interface.

Accurate nutrition analysis is crucial for promoting healthy
lifestyles. This study proposes a multi-modal deep learning approach integrating
advanced neural architectures, transfer learning, and data augmentation for
enhancing nutrition analysis from food images. The method combines food image
analysis with textual data, leveraging state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks for visual feature extraction and recurrent neural networks for text
processing. Transfer learning and data augmentation techniques like CutMix and
MixUp are employed to improve model performance. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed multi-modal
approach, achieving state-of-the-art results in food classification, nutrient
estimation, and dietary assessment. The results highlight the potential for realworld
applications in dietary monitoring, meal planning, and personalized
nutrition recommendations.
