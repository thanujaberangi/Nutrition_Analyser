This project aims to develop an advanced deep learning system for nutrition analysis using food images. The system integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing, transfer learning techniques,
and data augmentation methods to accurately classify food items and estimate their nutritional content. The project includes components for food recognition, nutrient estimation, meal planning, 
and personalized dietary recommendations. The system is implemented using Python, deep learning frameworks, and Streamlit for the user interface.
